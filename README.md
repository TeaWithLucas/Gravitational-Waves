# Gravitational Waves

At Ian's Request: DO NOT DELETE BRANCHES EVEN ONCE THEY ARE DONE

# Feature lifecycle

1. Create Issue for Feature/Bug
2. Assign weight to the issue during spring planning
3. Someone picks it up (assigns themselves to it) during the sprint
4. They create a feature branch for it using the format ['feature'/'bug']-[shortname]/[description]
5. Development....
6. Create Pull Request from feature branch to main
7. Another developer picks it up for Code Review
8. If any suggestions, write them in the comments, once all the issues are resolved, Approve the pull request
9. Press merge
